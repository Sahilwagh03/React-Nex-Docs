# Installation

Unlike other bloated libraries, React-nex empowers you to pick and choose the exact components you require. Simply leverage npx to install specific components directly into your project:

<Steps>
### Install  

<CommandBlock command="npm i react-nex@latest" />

### Configure your Tailwind

<Callout type="info">
  Ensure that you add the component path to the Tailwind CSS configuration. Add the following line to the Tailwind config file to enable Tailwind to purge unused styles:
</Callout>

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/components-react-nex/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  plugins: [],
};
```

</Steps>

## Component Installation
