# Installation

Unlike other bloated libraries, React-nex empowers you to pick and choose the exact components you require. Simply leverage npx to install specific components directly into your project:

You can install React-nex components via npm using `npx`:

```bash
npx react-nex add component_name
```

## Usage

Once you've installed the desired component, you can import and use it in your React application as follows:

```javascript
import { ComponentName } from './src/component-rect-nex/ComponentName';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ComponentName />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
